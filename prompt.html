You are a senior product engineer + brand designer. Build a production-grade landing page for an Iranian ride-sharing startup called "شوفر (shoffer)".

Goal:
Create a high-converting, ultra-modern, unicorn-style landing page that feels premium, bold, and startup-grade (similar quality to Stripe / Linear / Notion-style modern SaaS landing experiences, adapted for Persian audience and RTL).

Tech stack (strict):
- Next.js (latest, App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

Language and direction:
- Primary language: Persian (fa-IR), fully RTL
- Keep some micro labels in English only if it improves brand feel
- Tone: professional, confident, modern, trustworthy

Brand context:
- Product: Smart intercity carpooling platform connecting drivers and passengers
- Core values: safety, affordability, speed, trust
- Main CTA: دانلود اپ / شروع رایگان
- Secondary CTA: مشاهده نحوه کار

Design requirements:
- Unique, premium visual direction (not generic template)
- Strong typography hierarchy, excellent spacing, intentional grid system
- Color system with CSS variables/Tailwind theme tokens
- Rich background treatment (gradients + subtle shapes/noise), not flat white
- Bento-style feature layout
- Clean glassmorphism/card surfaces where appropriate
- Motion that feels meaningful: staggered reveals, hero entrance, hover states, scroll-triggered animations (Framer Motion)
- Mobile-first and fully responsive (320px to 2xl)
- Accessible contrast and keyboard-friendly interactions

Page sections:
1) Sticky Header (logo, nav anchors, CTA button)
2) Hero (big value prop, trust badge, 2 CTAs, product mock card)
3) Social Proof (stats + partner/client logos placeholders)
4) Features (bento grid, 6 feature cards)
5) How It Works (3 clear steps)
6) Trust/Safety section (identity verification, rating, support)
7) Testimonials (3 realistic Persian testimonials)
8) FAQ (accordion, 5 items)
9) Final CTA band (download options: Android / iOS / Web)
10) Footer (legal links, contact, social placeholders)

SEO and technical requirements:
- Proper metadata in app router (`title`, `description`, `keywords`, `openGraph`, `twitter`, `alternates.canonical`)
- Semantic HTML structure (header/main/section/footer, one H1)
- JSON-LD schemas:
  - SoftwareApplication
  - FAQPage
  - Organization
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- Fast loading and optimized layout shift behavior
- Use next/font for Persian-friendly font (e.g., Vazirmatn)
- Clean component architecture and reusable sections

Code quality:
- Create reusable typed components in a clear folder structure
- No inline messy styles; use Tailwind utility + small reusable patterns
- Keep code readable and production-ready
- Add concise comments only where necessary
- No fake libraries beyond requested stack

Deliverables:
- Full Next.js project code (App Router)
- `app/page.tsx` assembled with reusable section components
- `components/landing/*` section components
- `app/layout.tsx` with RTL and global metadata base
- `app/globals.css` with design tokens
- Framer Motion integration across key sections
- Ready to run with:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev

Conversion optimization:
- Keep CTAs visible and repeated strategically
- Copy should be benefit-driven and clear
- Include urgency/credibility microcopy where appropriate

Important:
- Do not generate a generic bootstrap-like page.
- The output must look premium, modern, and startup-investor-ready.
